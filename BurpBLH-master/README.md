# Usage

---

By default it passively scans the responses with Target "Scope in" . Make sure to add the targets into the scope. (Reason: To Avoid Noise)

`WHITELIST_CODES` - You can add status_code's to this list for more accurate results. 

ex: avoiding https redirects by adding `301`, if the path,url redirects to https.

`WHITELIST_PATTERN` - Regex extracting pattern based on given patterns.

- ex: /admin.php
- //google.com/test.jpg
- ../../img.src

`WHITELIST_MEMES` - Whitelisting MimeType to be processed for scanning patterns in responses if their Mime-Type matches.

ex: Mainly used to avoid performing regexes in `gif,img,jpg,swf etc`

`no_of_threads` - Increase no of threads , default : 15

# Output

- 2 Ways it outputs the broken links.
1. Broken Links which belongs to external origins.
2. Broken Links which belongs to same origins.
- If there are no external origin broken links then look for same origin broken links & return **same origin broken links.**
- if there are external origin broken links & same origin broken links then return only ***external origin broken links.***
